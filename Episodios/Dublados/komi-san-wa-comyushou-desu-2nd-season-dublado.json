As winter begins, the class is joined by the seemingly delinquent student Makoto Katai, who has been absent since the first week of school. Despite his intimidating appearance, Katai has difficulty communicating with others and just wants to befriend his classmates.\n\nAs new friendships form and current ones deepen, Komi and Tadano’s relationship begins to change—though not necessarily for the worse.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
