        "sinopse": "Hime Shiraki appears to have it all: an angelic voice, an innocent personality, and an adorable face that enamors all onlookers. However, her cuteness is all a lie—it is purely an act to achieve her self-centered goal of marrying a rich suitor. Though she often plays up her innocence to gain favor from those around her, Hime's facade does not absolve her of responsibility when an accident leaves Mai Koshiba injured.\n\nLearning that Mai is the manager of Café Liebe—a cafe themed as an all-girls academy—Hime is coerced into taking up a part-time position until Mai recovers. However, Hime's facade cannot cover up her shortcomings at being a waitress, earning her the ire of one of her coworkers, Mitsuki Yano, the elegant \"onee-sama\" who often berates Hime over her mistakes. As Hime struggles to adjust to her new job in addition to Mitsuki's unrelenting hostility, her real personality begins seeping through the cracks.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
