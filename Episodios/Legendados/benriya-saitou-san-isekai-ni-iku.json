        "sinopse": "Despite being a handyman with a wide range of skills, Saitou is severely undervalued and underpaid. When he complains, his boss fires him, claiming that he is easily replaceable. As if his luck was not bad enough, Saitou soon finds himself about to be run over by a truck on his way home.\n\nSurprisingly enough, Saitou does not die; instead, he is transported to another world. There, he meets a party composed of the female knight Raelza, the moonlight fairy Lafanpan, and the mage Morlock, who are all coincidentally looking to recruit a new member with a skill set like Saitou's.\n\nThroughout their time together, Saitou uses his expertise to assist his fellow party members and soon comes to receive the recognition he never thought was possible. However, Saitou's presence may just be the catalyst that will connect a diverse cast of people from different places, slowly uncovering the fate that could bring a great change to this world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
