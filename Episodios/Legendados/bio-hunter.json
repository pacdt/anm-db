        "sinopse": "In the molecular biology department of a major university, Komada and Koshigaya do more than just teach. They are also investigating demon viruses, which cause people to morph into grotesque creatures with a craving for human flesh. While conducting their research, the pair encounter Sayaka Murakami, the granddaughter of a famous fortune teller. Feeling compelled to help her find her missing grandfather, Komada and Koshigaya learn that a group of thugs is pursuing Sayaka. To make matters more sinister, these perpetrators seem to have a connection to the demon viruses.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
