        "sinopse": "In a society of people with animal characteristics, Belle Lablac stands out as the only person with no animal features at all. Curious of her origins, Belle leaves her hometown and heads to the city of Schubertland to be awarded the status of Nomad by Schubertland's ruler, King Rawhide. Through the journey, she is trained by the legendary swordsman Sian Lablac.\n\nUnfortunately for Belle, through a complication, she is unable to hurt others with her legendary sword Runding. The only choice to best her opponents in battle now is to break their swords, which is heavily looked down upon. Though ostracized for her appearance and hated for her disregard of societal norms, Belle stays resolute as she sets off on a perilous journey to find her rightful place in the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
