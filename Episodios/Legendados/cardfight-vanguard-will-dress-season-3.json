        "sinopse": "Using high-level plays by strong fighters as its base, the “UNI app” allows beginners to quickly improve their skills and has brought about a drastic change in how Vanguard is played. Cementing its place as a dream program with global appeal, Vanguard has become dominated by the Uniformers.\n\nMeanwhile, Masanori schemes in the shadows, the mysterious Shirogane has a string of tournament victories, Halona finally reveals her true capabilities, Sophie continues to hold the title of “The Strongest”, and Jinki aims to create the “ultimate fight” to fulfill his brother’s dying wish.\n\nThe ideal world envisioned by AI GUI is slowly coming to fruition – a world where everyone and anyone can become the strongest.\n\nWith the odds stacked against them, Yu-yu and friends must fight to reject this monotonous vision of Vanguard, and strive for the sake of enjoyable cardfights with individuality!\n\n(Source: cf-vanguard.com)",
