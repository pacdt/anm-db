        "sinopse": "Since childhood, Gaku Kitada has been fascinated with mathematics. As a student at the prestigious Wels Academy, he aimed to qualify for the Mathematics Olympiad and eventually secure admission to the University of Tokyo to become a great mathematician. His ambitious plans, however, do not come to fruition, as Gaku fails to qualify for the Olympiad's main event due to his anxiety and lack of self-confidence. This disastrous performance, coupled with his decision not to participate in future competitions, leads to his expulsion from the academy.\n\nDuring this crisis, Gaku meets Kai Asakura, an enigmatic professional chef who recognizes Gaku's peculiar way of cooking that incorporates math to create perfectly synergistic dishes. Despite his initial reservations, Gaku begins to utilize his mathematical perspective to cook, rekindling his love for the subject in the process. Wanting to understand this impulse more, Gaku decides to pivot his career trajectory to one that melds numbers with flavors to find solutions that can satisfy both his mind and the palate of his customers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
