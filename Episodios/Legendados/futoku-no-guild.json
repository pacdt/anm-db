        "sinopse": "Despite having a good reputation as one of the most seasoned guards in the local guild of Mebuki, Kikuru Madan believes he has been wasting his youth and hopes to spend the rest of it like any other person. However, his conscience prevents him from retiring at present, as he worries about the guild's future without him.\n\nCoincidentally—as if to help him find his successor—the guild's receptionist, Enome, assigns Kikuru four fresh recruits: the energetic beastwoman Hitamu \"Hitamuki\" Kyan, the prodigy Maidena Ange, the laid-back Toxico Dannar, and the stalwart Hanabata Nohkins. Although each of them possesses significant talents, they also display characteristics that detract from their potential—including Hitamu's extreme clumsiness and Hanabata's unintentional perverseness.\n\nAs if there was not enough to deal with, the monsters outside Mebuki's walls start exhibiting odd behavior by targeting women salaciously, causing the party endless problems in more ways than one. Nevertheless, Kikuru is committed to retiring early; to achieve his goal, the guidance he gives the trainees will be absolutely essential.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
