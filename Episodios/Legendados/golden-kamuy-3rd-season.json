        "sinopse": "After obtaining information about Asirpa from the foreteller Inkarmat, Saichi \"The Immortal\" Sugimoto, Genjirou Tanigaki, and Cikapasi join the Seventh Division's Otonoshin Koito and Hajime Tsukishima on a journey to Karafuto. Heading further north into the freezing Russian territory, they collect any clues about Asirpa's whereabouts they can find and rush after her.\n\nMeanwhile, Asirpa is unaware of what truly transpired at Abashiri Prison. Deeply disturbed and confused by her father Wilk's past actions, Asirpa follows his old friend Kiroranke to the place where Wilk was born and raised in order to better understand his motives. However, Kiroranke and the master sniper Hyakunosuke Ogata are scheming behind her back.\n\nEven if they were to obtain all 24 tattooed skins that form a map to the lost Ainu gold, the various factions searching for it now understand that the map is useless without Asirpa. Realizing the danger she could be in, Sugimoto desperately hopes to reach Asirpa first and protect her from the greedy clutches of those who plan to drag her into their sins.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
