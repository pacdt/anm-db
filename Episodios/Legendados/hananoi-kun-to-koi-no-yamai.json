        "sinopse": "Hotaru Hinase has lived nearly sixteen years without romance. She is satisfied alone as long as she can enjoy the little things in life with her beloved friends and family. In her mind, she is not meant to fall in love, nor does she understand the concept.\n\nWhile out with a friend, Hotaru witnesses the severe breakup of her schoolmate Hananoi, to whom she has never spoken. Afterward, she sees him sitting in the snow and holds her umbrella over him. To her surprise, this gesture results in him confessing his feelings for her at school the next day. Though Hotaru rejects him, Hananoi insists on letting her get to know him. He does whatever he can to woo her, from changing his hairstyle to finding her lost hairpin in the snow.\n\nAlthough she has no romantic feelings towards him, Hotaru believes that by spending more time with him, she will learn how to love. She agrees to date him and slowly begins to navigate what being a girlfriend entails, including how to reciprocate the kind gestures that Hananoi continues to perform for her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
