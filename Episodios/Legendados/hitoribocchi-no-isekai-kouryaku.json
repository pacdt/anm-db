        "sinopse": "High school student Haruka has always been a content loner. One day, he and his class are abruptly transported to another world and given skill points to use when choosing from an assortment of abilities and magical powers. Unfortunately, Haruka arrives last, and he can only use his points on the seemingly impractical abilities the others had no interest in. Although he is on his own again and must adjust to his new life by himself, he much prefers it that way.\n\nHowever, Haruka's peaceful solitude is short-lived, as he runs into some of his classmates. Weak to their pleas for help, he ends up sheltering and helping them reunite with the others. But the different cliques struggle to see eye to eye, forcing Haruka to find a way to end the infighting and restore harmony between them to survive the unfamiliar world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
