While trying to introduce herself in front of her class, she is interrupted by the tall and outgoing Yuushin Hirose. To make matters worse, their stark difference in height and personality starts to attract unwanted attention to Hiyori.\n\nDespite her unpleasant first impression of Yuushin, Hiyori becomes curious about his radiance. As the two set aside their differences, they quickly grow closer, encouraging Hiyori to break out of her shell.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
