For this, he has earned the interest of a research institution called \"Human Crazy University,\" which studies real-life miraculous phenomena and the people who become entangled in them.\n\nNow a subject of their research, Satake relates to them his memories of his immortal, yet unhappy, life. Why did he kill his fiancée? Soon enough, the truth sheds light on a much bigger conspiracy...\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
