        "sinopse": "Just as the famous writer Sensei is about to accomplish his life ambition and commit double suicide with his lover Sacchan, he is hit by a truck and transported to another world. Deemed an adventurer by the local priestess Annette, Sensei is given the daunting mission of slaying the demon king. Refusing to play into his new role, Sensei decides his efforts are better served looking for Sacchan in the hope that she is somewhere in this new world.\n\nEarly on in his journey, Sensei crosses paths with the martial artist Tama and unexpectedly saves her from mortal peril. Grateful for his actions, Tama decides to escort him. The pair are soon joined by Annette who, seduced by the writer's strong personality, has sworn to protect Sensei's life.\n\nAs the unlikely trio wander the dangerous, monster-infested lands, they soon realize that human beings might be the true threats to the peace of the world—and Sensei might be the only one with the power to stop them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
