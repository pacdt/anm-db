        "sinopse": "A lot has happened for Nagi Umino and Erika Amano: they were swapped at birth, learned of their engagement, and have started living under the same roof. The two now share their home with Nagi's sister, Sachi, and his crush, Hiro Segawa. Despite this unusual domestic situation and frequent quarreling, the group is beginning to settle into a life together.\n\nHowever, the return of Nagi's childhood friend Ai Mochizuki to Japan complicates things. Ai suddenly declares her intention to marry Nagi, and although he turns her down, she is committed to having him all to herself. Now with four girls around, each with their own thoughts about him, Nagi must figure out his own feelings and the best way forward.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
