Twelve years later, while the former contestants in the divine competition struggle to fit in society after they were turned into semi-permanents—beings unable to age—Lall refuses to let go of her brother, who has been forgotten by everyone.\n\nDetermined to resurrect her brother—the only one she sees fit to sit on the heavenly throne—Lall steals her his cellphone from a cult run by a past competitor, which accidentally restarts the competition. Helped by her classmate Eko Sasaki, Lall will show no mercy to prevail against her enemies in her efforts to finally see her brother again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
