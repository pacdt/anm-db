        "sinopse": "After receiving a text message offering to fulfill any of his wishes, high school student Gorou Ono successfully enacts his perverted fantasies with classmate Sawa Honoka. However, to his dismay, the granter of his wish materializes in the form of a demon named Lall. She informs him that he is now part of a game that will determine the next God of the world. As Gorou struggles to come to terms with this reality, Sawa attacks him with a giant sword, revealing that she also is part of this twisted competition for  the divine throne.\n\nEvery participant of the game receives a special power, and Gorou manages to kill his classmate with his ability: the Holy Book of the Fool. But this technique comes at a cost: Gorou's life gets worse every time he uses the book. As he learns more about this seemingly absurd competition, Gorou must find allies and learn how to use his newfound power before he loses everything.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
