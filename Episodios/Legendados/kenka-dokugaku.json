        "sinopse": "The bullies at Yoo Hobin's high school are no ordinary trouble-makers: they are NewTubers, budding internet celebrities who force Hobin to partake in humiliating videos and host live-streams in his house. Hobin only manages to stay strong by reminding himself that he needs to work hard to support his hospitalized mother. However, during his classmate Woo Jihyeok's live stream, Hobin completely snaps after a humiliating incident. As a result, the two men engage in a grotesque fistfight that lasts until dawn.\n\nThe following day, Hobin discovers that the livestream of his fight went viral on NewTube, turning him into a celebrity overnight. After he realizes that making viral videos is a very lucrative endeavor, Hobin agrees to team up with Jihyeok to create a channel that features his martial prowess. However, Hobin needs to become a seasoned fighter and keep his distance from those who seek to use him for his newfound fame, unless he wants a lack of views to become the least of his problems. Thankfully for him, the unexpected discovery of a series of obscure self-learning videos might be just what he needs to survive in the content creation industry.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
