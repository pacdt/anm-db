        "sinopse": "Due to his schoolmates, high school student Kimio Suga ends up in the girls' locker room. Thinking that this would be the end of his school career, he is surprised when his emotionless classmate Nozomi Komine covers for him. However, she allowed Kimio to escape for a reason: she requires someone to satisfy her perverted desire of revealing their bodies to each other.\n\nAlthough hesitant, Kimio has no choice but to comply because of Nozomi's constant blackmail. As the boy tries to figure a way out of his predicament, he finds himself growing closer to her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
