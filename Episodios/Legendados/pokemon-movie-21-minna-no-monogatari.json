        "sinopse": "As Satoshi continues his journey to become a Pokémon Master, he travels to Fura City to attend the annual Wind Festival. Pumped up, Satoshi and Pikachu are determined to win the festival's Get Race. Meanwhile, Kagachi, a show-off and a habitual liar, joins the competition at the request of his niece Lily. Having almost no knowledge about Pokémon, he manages to strike a deal with a socially awkward scientist named Torito in exchange for help with his upcoming speech. Following Kagachi's victory, Satoshi meets Risa, an ex-regional track and field champion looking to catch a Pokémon. However, during Torito's speech, Team Rocket strikes and manages to steal a capsule from his lab.\n\nTragedy strikes one after another as the Wind Festival's Sacred Flame disappears! As they set off on a journey to find the culprit, Satoshi and the group meet many people on the way—including Zeraora, the Thunderclap Pokémon who was believed to be dead...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
