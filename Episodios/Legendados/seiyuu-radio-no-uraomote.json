        "sinopse": "Experienced voice actor Yasumi Utatane works hard to maintain her image as a pure and innocent idol to please her fans, even as she struggles to find more jobs in the industry. But Yasumi has a secret—she is actually Yumiko Satou, a high school girl who prefers loose clothes and flashy jewelry, a complete contradiction to her false professional persona.\n\nAs Yasumi, Yumiko is finally offered an exciting opportunity to do a radio program alongside another up-and-coming voice actor she admires: Yuuhi Yuugure. In Yumiko’s eyes, Yuuhi’s cute looks and talented acting embody what a voice actor should be. As soon as they are introduced at the recording studio, however, Yumiko realizes that Yuuhi is actually her gloomy classmate, Chika Watanabe. Together, the pair commit to their radio program and slowly begin to open up. In supporting each other, Yumikoi and Chika gradually learn to be true to themselves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
