Enoshima is a small island floating in the Shonan Sea. On its beautiful and tranquil beach, there is the \"Private Enoshima Academy.\" The school gathers talented children from all over the country, and provides them with a gifted education using the latest equipment.\n\nSakko, Rimiya, and Toshi, who have been selected as students in the special reinforcement class \"Elements,\" are ordered to pilot the \"Vector Machine,\" a fighter plane powered by the power of emotion, and are forced to fight against the mysterious invasion weapon \"Mythical Beasts.\"\n\nIn the middle of the battle, guided by a mysterious vision, Sakko shouts out... \"Planetary Fusion! Go, Aquarion!\" \n\nAt the end of repeated reincarnation, the mechanical heavenly wing Aquarion appears.\nThe boys and girls, burdened with their destinies, will come face to face with the truth of the universe as the mysterious organization Space Egg Society and the intentions of adults intersect...\n\nThis is a grand myth of love spun with one's own feelings and the survival of the universe at stake.\n\n(Source: Official Site, translated)",
