        "sinopse": "Drugs have become the center of conflict in Japan, and crime involving them has been increasing at an alarming rate. Unable to control the chaos, the police department settled on creating a unit—STAND—that would include unique, specialized experts and professionals better suited to handle the pressing issue. \n\nRei Izumi is a novice joining the narcotics investigation unit, assigned the daunting task of recruiting the potential representatives of STAND. While recommended for her moral sense of justice and devotion to police work, Rei also has a unique aspect of her own that may have earned her the job—she has an immunity to many, if not most, kinds of drugs. \n\nEager to seek the possible members of STAND, Rei quickly learns that scouting the different individuals will be more difficult than she expected, as each candidate harbors their own feelings, ideologies, and willingness toward joining the team and regulating drugs as a whole. Her capability as a narcotics officer is also questioned by the many colorful personalities she meets, stirring conflict and unpredictability in Rei's daily life. However, persuading the various contenders for STAND isn't the only obstacle she faces, as becoming involved in the treacherous underworld of drugs, overflowing with deceit and secrecy, will be more hazardous than she ever imagined.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
