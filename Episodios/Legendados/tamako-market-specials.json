Home to mellow music and captivating conversations, the owner—Dera Mochimazzi—serves up dashing compliments and inspiring wisdom to his customers. However, in reality, the bar allows Dera to talk about his ludicrous whims to Tamako Kitashirakawa and her friends, whose responses often lead the discussion into comical off-topic banter.    \n\nOtchoko Choi-chan   \nExploring the world outside the tropical islands, Choi Mochimazzi passionately journals her experiences for the Prince. Choi's interest in her new friends' lifestyles spurs fruitful learning opportunities, yet growing accustomed to the different environment may be unexpectedly fascinating. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
