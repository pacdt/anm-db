        "sinopse": "Thrown out of the Silver Wings Battalion—one of the strongest guilds—Dennis is presented with the opportunity to fulfill his dream: opening a restaurant and putting his level 99 cooking skills to use. While setting up his new business, Dennis stumbles across a young enslaved girl named Atelier, seemingly of noble lineage. Reminded of his own past, he decides to free Atelier and hire her as a server.\n\nAs the restaurant opens its doors to first guests, Dennis and Atelier begin encountering more outcasts like themselves, all looking to talk about their personal problems over plates of delicious food. Unable to resist helping someone in need, Dennis goes out of his way to help with his customers' issues, whether it be with his incredible combat skills or unmatched cooking prowess.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
