        "sinopse": "Mai Otonashi, Rina Godai, Nozomi Mitaka, Sayuri Ichinose, and Nanase Nikaidou are all members of their high school's bowling club. The captain, Mai, can effortlessly land a \"turkey\"—three strikes in a row—yet her next delivery always ruins her game. Each girl struggles with the sport in her own way, but that never stops them from having fun.\n\nHowever, amusement is not enough for Rina. As the newest member, she is furious about the others' disregard for their failures. After an argument, Rina decides to quit the club, but Mai refuses to let her leave. During a match to determine if Rina stays, a strange incident occurs after Mai's turkey: the girls are sent back in time!\n\nThe group discover that they have landed right into the middle of a battlefield in the Sengoku period. They soon realize that recreating the match between Mai and Rina is the key to returning home. As the girls decide to enjoy their time in the unfamiliar era, Mai must prepare to score a turkey when it matters the most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
