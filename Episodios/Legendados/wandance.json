        "sinopse": "As Kaboku \"Kabo\" Kotani enrolls in Ichiran High School, he hopes to spend his high school days quietly to avoid standing out from everyone else because of his stuttering. While his friends join the school's basketball club, he looks to the dance club instead. However, due to an embarrassing memory from middle school, Koba has avoided dancing in front of others again, keeping him from joining the club.\n\nThings begin to change when Kabo spots his cute classmate Hikari Wanda dancing. As the two learn about each other, Wanda admits that she is not great with words either and prefers to express herself with her performances. This sparks a light in Kabo, and he decides to join the dance club despite his uncomfortable past. With Wanda and his new clubmates supporting him, Kabo sets out to improve his dancing, express himself freely, and create unforgettable memories one step at a time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
