The game world of Exgate he knew is no longer ruled by humans—and it is no longer just a game. Exgate is a world of its own where the characters think, feel, and live just like he does. Lufas journeys through Exgate, looking for the long-disbanded Twelve Stars of Heaven.\n\nLufas is without country, army, or allies. A question remains: what is the real reason an ordinary man was reincarnated into Exgate as Lufas?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
