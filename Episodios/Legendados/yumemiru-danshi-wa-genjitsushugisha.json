His usual day revolves around shadowing her and confessing his undying love at every turn. However, a moment of epiphany leads Wataru to relinquish his childish behavior and face the reality that she will never return his one-sided feelings. He distances himself from Aika and spends his newfound spare time with his friends and in the company of other lovely girls.\n\nAs Wataru moves on, Aika starts approaching him in unusually suggestive ways—making him question whether giving up on his love was the right decision after all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
