        "sinopse": "The Yuzuki family, which consists of four brothers, lost their parents two years ago. Hayato, the eldest son, is a hard worker and the pillar of the family. Mikoto, the second son, is calm and collected, but he has a soft spot for his younger brother Minato, whom he adores and thinks is cute. Minato, the third son, is energetic and adores his brothers, but he is clumsy and awkward. Gakuto, the fourth son, is a studious and mature first-grader who is often referred to as a \"wise man.\" The manga depicts the four brothers' daily lives as they navigate their family, school, and community.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
