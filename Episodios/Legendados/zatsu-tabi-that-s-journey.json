        "sinopse": "Chika Suzugamori, an 18-year-old newcomer manga artist, has just had three of her drafts rejected in a single day. Her editor suggests incorporating her interests into her work, but Chika is an indoor person who only thinks about manga day and night. At a loss, she feels a sudden desire to get away from everything and go on a journey somewhere. \n\nDue to the results of an online poll that she posted on a whim, Chika hops on a train and heads north from Tokyo on an impromptu solo trip. When she ends up at the top of Mount Haguro in Aizu-Wakamatsu, she realizes she feels refreshed and more motivated than before. Even if her projects get turned down again in the future, Chika plans to journey around Japan with friends old and new.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
